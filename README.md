## My Contribution
In this project, I designed and implemented the API endpoints for property management, user authentication, and property filtering. I also integrated Swagger for API documentation, making it easier for developers to interact with and extend the API. My work focused on optimizing database interactions with Hibernate to ensure quick response times and smooth data handling.
